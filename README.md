# WELCOME TO THE SPARKLECARE ARCHIVES!
An archive of all official publicly-released art from the webcomic Sparklecare! This archive will be updated over time as new art is posted, and as higher res images become available. If you have any art not here, please submit it to me!

IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE ART FROM TUMBLR IS AS HIGH-QUALITY AS POSSIBLE, DO THE FOLLOWING:
1. right-click the image and click 'open in new tab'
2. look at the address bar. the filename should say 'tumblr_(random numbers and letters)_500.png/jpg OR _1280.png/jpg
3.  if it says 1280, skip this step. if 500, edit the address to say 1280
4.  right-click the new version. click 'save image as...', and hit save. 
5.  done!

please note that doesn't always work because as of a few months ago (i think?) tumblr has started using different urls for image files, but it seems rather random which ones are given new ones and which ones keep the 500/1280 format! always better to try at least 

I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH THE ZANY CLOWN POSSE OR THE COMIC ITSELF! i am merely a very dedicated fan with a strong passion for archival, media preservation and easy access.

have a good day! ✨❤️🧡💛💚💙💜✨
